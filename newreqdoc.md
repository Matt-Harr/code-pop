## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 System Scope Expansion

**2.1.1 Multi-Store, Nationwide Support (M)**

The CodePop platform must support deployment across multiple stores distributed throughout the United States. Each store operates as an independent unit while still participating in regional coordination for supply, logistics, and data synchronization. Stores must be able to function autonomously in day-to-day operations, even if other stores or regional systems are unavailable.

The system must allow for:
- Independent store configuration (inventory, machines, staff roles)
- Regional grouping of stores for supply and logistics coordination
- Expansion to new stores without requiring downtime or reconfiguration of existing locations
- Store-specific operational parameters and customization

**2.1.2 Decentralized Architecture (M)**

The system must operate using a decentralized architecture. There is no single central server that controls all stores nationwide. Instead:
- Each store maintains its own local operational data
- Stores communicate directly with other stores in the same region as needed
- Stores communicate directly with regional supply hubs
- Regional data synchronization must tolerate intermittent or unstable connectivity

In the event of connectivity loss:
- Local store operations (ordering, inventory tracking, machine operation) must continue uninterrupted
- Synchronization of data (inventory usage, maintenance logs, demand metrics) must resume automatically once connectivity is restored
- Conflicts during synchronization must be resolved using timestamp-based or priority-based reconciliation rules

### 2.2 Supply & Logistics System

**2.2.1 Supply Hubs (M)**

The system must support seven (7) regional supply hubs, each assigned to a specific geographic region:

- **Region A:** Chicago, IL
- **Region B:** New Jersey / New York
- **Region C:** Logan, UT
- **Region D:** Dallas, TX
- **Region E:** Atlanta, GA
- **Region F:** Phoenix, AZ
- **Region G:** Boise, ID

Each supply hub is responsible for managing and distributing ingredients, machine parts, and other consumables required for store operations.

Supply hubs must be capable of delivering to:
- Stores located within their assigned region
- Stores located in other regions, provided the destination store is within a 1000-mile delivery radius

The system must allow hubs to manage:
- Current stock levels
- Outgoing and incoming shipments
- Estimated delivery times
- Cross-region fulfillment when a closer hub lacks sufficient inventory

**2.2.2 Supply Coordination (M)**

Managers and logistics administrators must be able to coordinate supplies through multiple channels:
- Local store inventory tracking
- Shared local suppliers (e.g., regional syrup or CO₂ vendors)
- At least one assigned regional supply hub

The platform must provide a unified interface for viewing:
- Current store inventory
- In-transit shipments
- Hub availability and fulfillment capacity
- Supplier lead times

AI-assisted demand prediction must be used to forecast future supply needs. This prediction system must:
- Use historical usage data from individual stores and regions
- Support CSV-based data ingestion for historical records and external forecasting inputs
- Continuously update forecasts based on real-time usage trends

The system must generate actionable recommendations, such as:
- Suggested reorder quantities
- Optimal sourcing location (local supplier vs. supply hub)
- Recommended reorder timing to prevent shortages

### 2.3 Machine Maintenance Tracking

**2.3.1 Maintenance System Overview (M)**

Each store must track all operational machines used in drink preparation and fulfillment. For every machine, the system must store:
- Machine type and model
- Operational start date
- Current maintenance status
- Complete maintenance and repair history

This information must be available to:
- Store managers
- Regional maintenance coordinators
- Authorized logistics or technical administrators

**2.3.2 Maintenance Status Types (M)**

The system must support the following machine states:

- **normal:** Machine is operating within expected parameters
- **warning:** Machine is operational but exhibiting early indicators of potential failure
- **repair-start:** Machine has entered an active repair state
- **repair-end:** Repair has been completed and machine is ready for operation
- **error:** Machine has encountered a fault requiring attention
- **out-of-order:** Machine is not operational and cannot be used
- **schedule-service:** Machine is due for routine or preventive maintenance

Transitions between states must be logged automatically with timestamps and responsible personnel (when applicable).

**2.3.3 Repair Optimization (S)**

The system should optimize repair and maintenance schedules using AI-assisted planning. Optimization objectives include:
- Minimizing total technician travel time across stores
- Respecting maximum allowable time between service visits for each machine type
- Preventing machines in a **warning** state from exceeding safe operational thresholds

The optimization system should consider:
- Geographic location of stores
- Technician availability
- Severity and priority of machine issues
- Historical failure patterns
